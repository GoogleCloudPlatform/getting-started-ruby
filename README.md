# Ruby Getting Started

## BASE APPLICATION

I wanted a branch of the Bookshelf application that contains all of the
views but no database persistence or anything specific to a particular
technology choice, eg. database choice or task queueing choice.

That's what this is.

When I work on views, I like to work on them here and merge this into
the SQL and Datastore branches, etc.  So I don't need to deal with
cherry picking or anything like that.

But that's just my preferred workflow!  :)
